## 📌 Project Description

The **DP Visualizer** is a web application that allows users to explore dynamic programming algorithms step by step. It shows how DP tables fill up and how subproblems are solved, helping learners and developers understand algorithm design patterns visually and interactively.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🎯 **Interactive Visualization**: Step through DP solutions in real time (e.g., Unique Paths, Coin Change).
- ⏯ **User Controls**: Play, pause, step, and reset animations.
- 🧮 **Custom Grid Engine**: Simulates DP table updates with animations.
- ♿ **Accessible & Modular**: Well-structured and extensible codebase.
- 💡 **Future Enhancements**:
  - Multi-language syntax highlighting (via Prism.js).
  - Advanced animation for value propagation.
